 Earthquakes have caused a lot of issues around the world where many people, businesses, animals, and infrastructure
 have been affected, this article explains in depth about how earthquakes trigger soil liquefaction, and what soil 
 liquefaction is, and how it has affected major buildings and monuments. Furthermore, the step by step mechanism of 
 soil liquefication will be explained in detail

<pre>
 Earthquakes occur when two tectonic plates under the earths surface move and collide with each other causing massive
 shakes on land that are measured in ‘magnitudes. Now soil liquefication is a phenomenon that takes place when water
 saturated in lose granules of sand is shaken up due to the seismic activities caused by the earthquake. This shaking
 affects the water pressure in the soil, which reduces the contact between the soil particles, which loosens soils 
 strength, and in the long term affects the foundation of all infrastructure putting billions of lives at risk. This
 is why many civil engineers are taking active action in finding out how to correct this issue for future projects and 
 developments. Civil engineers stress that it is necessary to consider soil deformations and hence, how stresses and
 strains are redistributed through the structure. 1) June 13 2025.

 The mechanism of soil liquefication
 
 Under normal conditions the soil used for foundations is tightly packed and has water pores in them to keep it
 strong (that’s just the type of soil used) and during soil liquefication cyclic ground movements due to 
 earthquakes, makes the soil a lot denser, as water can’t dissolve or evaporate quickly, and so pore pressure 
 would build up. This isn’t a good thing as the soils strength decreases and its effectiveness of behaving as
 a good foundation decreases to nearly zero. The grains of the soil end up floating in the water that hasn’t 
 dissipated and so the soil ends up behaving as a liquid instead of a solid, and so even small amounts of load 
 can compress this soil. Due to this loss of strength and its behaviour, its new state is solid like, and is now 
 capable of causing buildings to collapse. 2 John P. Rafferty, May 27, 2011

 
 Ground Deformation and Structural Consequences
 
 The most damage usually results from ground deformation caused by liquefaction due to seismic activity shaking. 
 Modern case studies from Christchurch, New Zealand explains that deformation due to liquefication has a long lasting 
 detrimental effect on entire civilizations. There are a few important types of deformation worth mentioning such as:
 settlement, lateral spreading, flow failures, and ground fissuring. 
 
1.Settlement
 
 When the liquefied soil hardens and strengthens after an earthquake, the ground undergoes a type of settlement. This 
 settlement may cause structures to have weaker foundations and cause them too sink, which is actually less disastrous 
 in many cases. However differential settlement is so much more disastrous and destructive, as more parts of the building
 move than others. This causes slanted floors, cracking of pillars and foundation, and tilting. 

 
2.Lateral spreading 

 Lateral spreading is one of the more worrying factors most engineers worry about as its one of the most destructive types
 of deformation. This type of deformation occurs when the soil has lost its strength and deposits itself to nearby free 
 spaces such as riverbanks, slopes or excavations. 3)  Bray and Macedo (2017) explain that lateral spreading is similar 
 horizontal displacement driven by the motion of unstable layers of soil underground. These displacements can reach really 
 high heights, depending on the physical properties of the soil. Due to this ground distortion, foundations may get destroyed, 
 pipelines may rupture, and serious damage could be caused to bridges and waterfront architecture. 

3.Flow failures 
 
 Flow failures are observed when thick, loose saturated soil contents liquefy completely and behave like a flowing body of 
 soil 4) Francisco Manuel Salgado June 2019. Flow failures usually occur on slopes and can be extremely harmful to the 
 environment, life, and infrastructure, dragging entire structures down the slope causing a tsunami like wave to pick up and 
 destroy whatever’s in its way. Although the chances of this occurring is very rare compared to lateral spreading and settlement,
 flow failures are cataclysmic when they do occur as they involve heavy loads of semi liquified soil to move rapidly across 
 massive spreads of land. 

4.Ground fissures
 
 Liquification usually produces Sand boils (Sand boils are little volcano-looking mounds of sand that pop up on the ground
 surface during liquefaction) , water ejections, and fissures in the ground. These are usually smaller issues when compared
 to the other issues previously explained, however they still pose risks worth worrying about. Sand boils can fully erode
 surface layers, and damage pavements and roads. Ground fissures on the other hand widen  structural connections, break 
 roads and expose utilities under the ground like pipelines and electrical wires. A real life example of this would be New
 Zealand, Christchurch, where the spreading of sand boils and ground fissuring caused loss of major roads and sewer
 networks that costed the government a fortune to renovate.

 In conclusion earthquake induced soil liquefaction remains a massive threat to modern architecture and infrastructure
 worldwide. Settlement, flow failures, lateral spreading, and fissuring can severely cause harm to  buildings, businesses,
 bridges, ports, and underground facilities and utilities. With modern help from engineers, soil improvement, reinforced 
 foundation systems, and tweaked hazard improvements, can greatly reduce the harm caused by soil liquefaction.
